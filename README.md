Nutriware-an online informatic system for nutritionists.

I designed and developed a system aimed at Greek nutritionists
allowing them to access their clientsâ€™ data on-the-go, create new custom diets
for each client by accessing thousands of greek recipes and their nutritional
values. To do so, I worked with professional nutritionists who helped me
understand their needs and expectations out of a system. The resulting
software came to be about 16 kloc. As of now, many nutritionists use
Nutriware for their profeesional needs, either exclusively or in combination
with other systems.
